# Version 1.0.6

Fixed an issue when creating a new slideshow, it was trying to access the currently active slide and since there wasn't one, it was causing an error.

Deleting a journal entry wasn't refreshing the page if it was open in the current tab.

If a DC was attempted to be added, but wasn't saved properly, the old DC was still there but causing errors.  I changed the code so that DCs aren't created the first time until the save button is pushed.

Dragging items onto the Quest entry wasn't working.

Journal Notes weren't cross linking to other notes.  Looks like the way the TextEditor was sending the information wasn't compatible with the Enhanced Journal.

Directory Searchign is fixed.

Also thank you to Riccisi for some amazing debug work.
